# Data Science project: mushroom classification
 
[This mushroom dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification) (donated to UCI ML 27 April 1987) includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.
